# Maritime Heritage Collection

> **Important Note**: This entire project, including every single line of code, documentation, and text, was generated entirely by AI using Cursor IDE. No human wrote or modified any part of this codebase or documentation. This serves as a demonstration of AI's capabilities in full-stack development.

## Project Overview

This project was created as a test case for using Cursor (an AI-powered IDE) to develop a React application. The goal was to evaluate how effectively AI could assist in building a complete web application, from initial setup to final documentation. The result is a beach-themed historical cataloging site that demonstrates modern React practices, TypeScript integration, and responsive design.

## 🚀 Features

- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS
- **Smooth Animations**: Powered by Framer Motion for fluid transitions and interactions
- **Responsive Design**: Fully mobile-friendly layout
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript implementation
- **Component Architecture**: Well-organized, modular component structure
- **Beach Theme**: Custom color palette and styling inspired by coastal elements
